=head1 NAME

Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz - performs Neo-Riemann operations on set classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz ();
  my $nrt = Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz->new;

  # "parallel" changes Major to minor
  $nrt->transform( 'P', [60, 64, 67] );   # [60, 63, 67]
  $nrt->transform( 'P', [60, 63, 67] );   # [60, 64, 67]

  # or multiple operations (LPR)
  my $tasks = $nrt->taskify_tokens('LPR');
  my $new_pitch_set = $nrt->transform($tasks, 0, 3, 7);

  # Sevenths (4-27 only), e.g. F+ to C-
  $nrt->transform( 'S34', [65,69,72,75] ); # [66,70,72,75]

The L<Music::LilyPondUtil> module will assist with converting between
lilypond note names and raw pitch numbers; this module deals with only
the raw pitch numbers (integers).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Performs Neo-Riemannian operations on major and minor triads (set class
C<3-11>), and sevenths (set class C<4-27>).

This is a very new module, use with caution, things may change, etc.

=head2 TRIAD OPERATIONS (3-11)

Available operations (called "tokens" in this module) for the
B<transform> method on members of set class 3-11:

  P  Parallel
  R  Relative
  L  Leittonwechsel
  N  Nebenverwandt (RLP)
  S  Slide (LPR)
  H  "hexatonic pole exchange" (LPL)

=head2 SEVENTH OPERATIONS (4-27)

These are derived from [Childs 1998] and operate only on members of set
class 4-27. For example, the C<S23> will convert a F+ chord C<F A C Eb>
into F- C<F# A C E>, or a F- chord into a F+, and so forth:

       F+   F-
  ----------------
  S23  F-   F+
  S32  F#-  E+
  S34  C-   Bb+
  S43  B-   B+
  S56  D-   Ab+
  S65  D#-  G+
  C32  D+   G#-
  C34  Ab+  D-
  C65  B+   B-

These always change two notes while holding the other two invariant;
there is also a 10th (here unnamed) operation that holds three pitches
invariant e.g. F+ C<[0,3,5,9]> to A- C<[0,3,7,9]>. But there is no
network of changes while holding three invariant, only toggling between
one or the other of two chords.

=head2 TOKEN NAMES

Token names are at present defined to be upper case ASCII letters (A-Z),
followed by zero to many lower case ASCII letters or numbers (a-z0-9).
Tokens will not perform any changes to a pitch set unless suitable code
is added to the transformation table (a hash of token names to CODE
references).

=head2 EXTENSION TO ARBITRARY SET CLASSES

Most operations on most set classes are undefined. Use the
C<eg/nrt-study-setclass> program under the distribution of this module
to graph arbitrary set classes. Otherwise, software exploiting links
between related forms of a set class would not need to know the name
of the link being followed (but humans might to help analyze what is
going on).

=head1 METHODS

The code may C<croak> if something goes awry; catch these errors with
e.g. L<Try::Tiny>. The B<new> method is doubtless a good one to begin
with, and then B<transform> to just experiment around with the
transformations.

=over 4

=item B<new> I<parameter_pairs ...>

Constructor.

=over 4

=item B<DEG_IN_SCALE> => I<positiveinteger>

A 12-tone system is assumed, though may be changed, though I have no
idea what that would do.

  Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz->new(DEG_IN_SCALE => 17);

=back

=item B<normalize> I<pitch_set>

Normalizes the given pitch set (a list or array reference of pitch
numbers, which in turn should be integers) via code that is something
like B<normal_form> of L<Music::AtonalUtil> but slightly different.
Returns in list context a string of the normalized pitch set (such as
C<0,4,7> for a Major triad), and a hash reference that maps the
normalized pitch set pitch numbers to the original pitches of the input
I<pitch_set>. In scalar context, just the string of the normalized pitch
set is returned:

  use Music::LilyPondUtil         ();
  use Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz ();
  my $lyu = Music::LilyPondUtil->new;
  my $nrt = Music::NeoRiemannianTonnetz->new;

  scalar $nrt->normalize( $lyu->notes2pitches(qw/c e g/) ) # 0,4,7

This method is used internally by the B<transform> method, or can be
used to explore the C<3-11>, C<4-27>, or other arbitrary set classes:

  chord        normalized  set class
  <c e g>      [0,4,7]     3-11
  <c ees g>    [0,3,7]     3-11
  <f a c ees>  [0,3,6,8]   4-27
  <fis a c e>  [0,2,5,8]   4-27

Neo-Riemannian operations need this unique normalized form as the set
class conflates these different forms into the same Forte Number
(C<3-11>) or prime form pitch set (C<[0,3,7]>), and Neo-Riemannian
operations must do different things depending on whether the triad is
major or minor, or is C<[0,3,6,8]> or C<[0,2,5,8]>.

There are scripts under the C<eg/> directory of the distribution of this
module that explore the normalize/atonal prime form set space.

=item B<taskify_tokens> I<tokens>, [ I<tasks> ]

Converts tokens (a string such as C<RLP> (three tokens, C<R>, C<L>, and
C<P>), or an array reference of such) to a list of tasks (CODE
references) returned as an array reference, assuming all went well with
the taskification.

=item B<techno> [ I<measurecount> ]

Generates techno beats (returned as a list). The optional
I<measurecount> should be a positive integer, and doubtless a
power of two.

=item B<transform> I<tokens>, I<pitch_set>

Transforms the given I<pitch_set> (a list or array reference of pitch
numbers, ideally integers) via the given I<tokens>. If I<tokens> is
not an array reference, it is fed through the B<taskify_tokens>
method first. Returns the new pitch set (as an array reference) if
all goes well.

The resulting pitch set will be ordered from lowest pitch to highest;
Neo-Riemannian theory cares little about chord inversions, and will
convert root position chords to and from various inversions:

  # C-major to F-minor (2nd inversion)
  $nrt->transform('N', 60, 64, 67); # [60, 65, 68]

=back
